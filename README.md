# Data analysis covering the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of passenger cars in 2018 in Europe

## motivation
This data analysis study tries to answer the following questions  
* Which vehicle characteristics show a significant influence on the vehicles CO<sub>2</sub> emission?
* How can OEMs (car manufacturers) reduce their fleet emissions?
* When is the best time to buy an electrified vehicle in europe?

## libraries used
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* numpy

## files in the repository
* passengerCarCO2EmissionsAnalysis.ipynb - jupyter noteboook with all data analysis steps
* BLOG_passengerCarCO2EmissionsAnalysis.pdf - "offline" blog entry with the studies findings
* passengerCarCO2EmissionsAnalysis.html - preview of the jupyter notebook

## summary of the results
If you are considering buying an electrified vehicle in Europe, you may want to wait until the end of 2020. At this time, many manufacturers will be forced to bring more electric vehicles onto the market via probably unprecedented low-cost offers.
